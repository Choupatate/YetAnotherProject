# Feature spec — F1: Authors ("two voices, one book")

Follow-up feature to be implemented **after** the fixes in `REVIEW.md`. Same
ground rules as `PLAN.md`: all decisions are made here — implement, don't
redesign. No new dependencies. Everything stays plain markdown on disk.

## What it is

Multiple family members (e.g. Papa and Maman) write stories in the **same
shared timeline** — one book, several narrators. Each story carries its
author, and each author has their own color so the two voices are clearly
distinguishable at a glance on the timeline and on story pages.

There are still **no accounts**: one shared password, one login. The author is
a label on the story, not an identity system. Do not add users, permissions,
or per-author passwords.

## 1. Configuration

New env var, documented in `.env.example` and the README config table:

```
STORYBOOK_AUTHORS="Papa:#d9a441,Maman:#7ba7d9"
```

- Comma-separated `Name:#hexcolor` pairs. Name is a display string (unicode
  allowed, no commas or colons); color is a CSS hex color chosen by that
  author.
- Parse in `create_app()` into `app.config["AUTHORS"]`: an ordered list of
  `{"name": ..., "color": ...}` dicts. On a malformed entry, raise
  `RuntimeError` at startup with a message showing the expected format (fail
  fast, like the SECRET_KEY check).
- **If unset or empty, the entire feature is invisible**: no selector in the
  editor, no bylines, no legend — the app behaves exactly as today. All
  templates and JS must guard on this.
- README should advise picking mid-brightness colors that read well on both
  the dark and light background, and state that renaming an author in the env
  var does not rewrite existing files (see §2).

## 2. Storage (frontmatter)

- New **optional** frontmatter field on `index.md`: `author: Papa` (the plain
  name string, not the color — colors live only in config so they can be
  retuned anytime).
- `Story` dataclass gets `author: Optional[str] = None`.
- `_write_index()` / `create_story()` / `save_story()` pass it through;
  omit the key entirely when the story has no author.
- **Unknown author names must never break anything.** A story whose `author`
  is not in the configured list (author renamed, config lost, file copied
  from elsewhere) renders with the byline text but the neutral default accent
  color. The files outlive the config; tolerate drift silently.

## 3. API

- `POST /api/stories` and `PUT /api/stories/<id>` accept an optional
  `author` string.
- Validation: if `STORYBOOK_AUTHORS` is configured and a non-empty `author`
  is provided, it must be one of the configured names → otherwise 400 JSON
  error (the UI is a picker; anything else is a bug or tampering). Empty /
  missing author is always allowed. If no authors are configured, ignore the
  field entirely.

## 4. Editor UI

- Below the date input, a row of **author chips** (one `<button type="button">`
  per configured author): the author's name with a small filled dot in their
  color. Tapping selects (one at a time; tapping the selected chip deselects
  → story saved without author). Selected chip gets a visible border in the
  author color + `aria-pressed="true"`. Rendered server-side from config;
  hidden entirely when no authors configured.
- Preselection order: the story's existing `author` when editing; otherwise
  `localStorage["storybook-author"]` if it matches a configured name;
  otherwise none. On change, store the choice in `localStorage` — each
  parent's phone remembers who they are, so after the first time it's
  zero-tap.
- `editor.js` includes the selected author in both create and update payloads.
  This must also apply to the auto-create that happens on first image upload
  (`ensureStoryId`), and the fallback textarea editor path must support the
  chips identically (they live outside the editor widget, so this should be
  free — verify it).

## 5. Story page

- Byline appears inside the existing date line:
  `JUNE 18, 2023 · MAMAN`, where the author name is preceded by a small
  colored dot (author's color) and the name uses the same small-caps style as
  the date. No author → date line unchanged.
- The `<hr class="story__flourish">` under the title takes the author's color
  (neutral accent when no/unknown author). Subtle, but it tints the whole
  page's mood toward its narrator.

## 6. Timeline — the "clear visual split"

This is the heart of the feature. Three coordinated cues, all driven by a
single inline `style="--author-color: #7ba7d9"` custom property set on the
entry when the story has a configured author (entries without an author keep
the neutral accent via the variable's fallback):

1. **The dot** on the spine is filled with the author's color and slightly
   enlarged (visible at arm's length — this is the primary cue).
2. **The author's name** appears after the date in the entry's date line
   (`Jun 18 · Maman`), in the author's color, same small size as the date.
3. **A legend** at the top of the timeline (only when ≥1 author configured):
   one chip per author — colored dot + name — so the color mapping is
   self-explanatory to a reader who has never seen the app. Static, not a
   filter (filtering is out of scope; add to "Ideas for later" if tempted).

Implementation notes: pass the configured author→color mapping into the
template from the route (build a dict once); do not inline hex values in CSS —
everything reads `var(--author-color, var(--accent))`.

## 7. Seed + tests + docs

- `scripts/seed_demo.py`: give the existing sample stories a mix of two
  authors and one story with no author, so the timeline demonstrates the
  split out of the box (seed works regardless of env config since unknown
  authors degrade gracefully).
- Tests to add:
  - config parsing (valid, malformed → RuntimeError, unset → feature off),
  - author round-trip through create/update API and frontmatter,
  - API 400 on unknown author when list configured; accepted when list not
    configured,
  - story/timeline pages render byline and legend when configured, and render
    identically to today when not,
  - unknown author on disk → page renders, neutral color.
- Update README (config table, a short "Several narrators" paragraph) and
  `.env.example`.

## Definition of done

- With `STORYBOOK_AUTHORS` unset: pixel-identical behavior to before (no
  selector, no legend, no bylines); all pre-existing tests untouched and green.
- With two authors configured: creating a story from a phone as "Maman" takes
  zero extra taps after the first visit; the timeline shows both voices
  clearly split by color with a legend; `index.md` on disk contains
  `author: Maman` and nothing about colors.
- Bare `pytest` green from a clean checkout.
